# opencv-document-scanner
This "Document Scanner" project utilizes OpenCV to preprocess an image, detect the document's contours, reorder them, apply a perspective transform, and crop the result. It handles grayscale conversion, blurring, edge detection, contour finding, and warping, providing a clean, scanned-like output of the document.
